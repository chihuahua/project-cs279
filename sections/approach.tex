\section{Approach}

% This section should include a description of our technology / approach.
% This is the technology-related section.
In order to tackle this problem we will perform the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Control for difference in application cost by only using free applications
\item Obtain approximately 500 mobile applications and 5000 participants 
\item Utilize the application store: Preference towards Androids since they publicly provide download statistics
\item Use samples from games and productivity applications
\item Incentivize users by making the study fun to complete and additionally taking advantage of users from Mechanical Turk to cover the remaining numbers required.
\item Performing a quick survey for the first five users
\item Display applications in different orders to weed out systematic preferences based on order.
\item Utilizing apps with roughly the same distribution of dates of release
\item Separating applications into two categories: (1) relatively new to the market, so users have not seen them before, and (2) been in the market for a while
\item Displaying a mock-up of the application store listing (all must be the same except for the variable being tested)
\item Scaping the the names, icons, and descriptions of the aforementioned applications from the Android store
\end{itemize}
