\section{Approach}

% This section should include a description of our technology / approach.
% This is the technology-related section.

control for difference in application cost by only having free applications
~500 applications and ~5000 participants (need a big sample, so results can be generalized)
application store: Android since it is the application marketplace that publicly provides download statistics
subset of apps: games + productivity (because the use of games is discretionary, so something else that people need to use)

experiment will be completed based on incentivizing users by making the study fun to complete. If not enough users complete the study in this way, we will proceed to obtain some users via Mechanical Turk.
setup: quick survey + first batch of 5
show applications in different order to different people (so there will be no systematic differences)
try to have roughly the same distribution of dates for when the applications were released
separate applications into 2 categories: (1) relatively new to the market, so users have not seen them before, and (2) been in the market for a while
show mock-up of application store listing (all must be the same except for the variable being tested)

To obtain data, we plan to scrape the names, icons, and descriptions of aforementioned applications
