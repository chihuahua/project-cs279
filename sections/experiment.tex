\section{Experiment}

% This section is the meat of the paper
% This section should carefully describe the experiment and our analysis (design of the experiment)
“How good is your entrepreneurial gut?”  We will focus on gamification as an incentive. In addition, we will conduct a survey on application habits of consumers prior to the actual study.  Our survey will consist of the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item How often do you use a smartphone?
\item How often do you download apps?
\item How often do you use apps?
\item How old are you?
\item What is your gender?
\item Where are you from?
\end{itemize}

For the actual study, our questionnaire will ask subjects to rate applications based on the different qualities using a Likert scale:

\begin{itemize}
\item Does this pages feel fun?
\item How clear does the page describe the app’s purposes and functionalities?
\item How useful do you think the application will be based on its icon?
\end{itemize}

Participants who have seen the application before will have their answers discarded.  

Experiment design: description and 4 apps → which app do you think is the most successful one?
results given in groups of 5, then “do you want to try again?” → next batch of 5
