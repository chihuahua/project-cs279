\section{Experiment}

% This section is the meat of the paper
% This section should carefully describe the experiment and our analysis (design of the experiment)

Following this approach, we scraped the titles, icons, download figures, and first screenshots of 500 popular game apps that were recently released in the Android marketplace.  To gather our results, we built a site that asked subjects to select which app, in their opinion, had the highest likelihood of success through an iterative process that ended when the user decided to quit.  We released the survey to our friends on Facebook and our classmates on Piazza. Although the initial release included only the apps' names and icons, the subsequent version we propagated displayed screenshots. Moreover, the goal for the additional inclusion was to determine if incorporating screenshots could lead users to achieve more accurate predictions after our original results proved to be somewhat insignificant.  \\

For the analysis portion, we used a variant of the Bradley-Terry algorithm to assign ratings to game apps. Uniformly distributed binary-comparison trials were automated with server-side logic. We hypothesize that since people decide to download apps using relatively quick, perfunctory measures, crowds can provide reasonable measures of app success when given an apps icon, title, and screenshot. We also compared the accuracy of subjects' predictions with and without screenshots and confined parts of our analyses to subjects who completed at least ten contiguous rounds.\\

To counter bias due to varying degrees of experience with smartphone applications, we asked subjects questions about their habits before beginning the study. We also displayed the title and icons for only fifteen seconds to the user. Because we were relying on user participation solely through the leveraging of social media outlets, we decided to gamify our study to better incentivize potential participants to perform our experiment. With the promise of determining our user's business acumen, we drew users additionally with our slogan: â€œHow good is your entrepreneurial gut?"\\

For the crux of the study in which we had subjects compare apps, we asked subjects to choose the app they thought would be more successful.  Again, we wanted to ensure that participants who had knowledge of a particular app for a certain trial could not allow that knowledge to influence their decision, so we discarded trials in which users had self-reported prior knowledge of at least one app. For each given trial, there was a 20\% probability that our users would have to justify their selection. Due to past unhelpful or blank responses, we made our users response exceed at least five characters to somewhat deter no responses. Although we originally had subjects justify their selection after every trial, we quickly switched our justifications to approximately 20\% of the time in hopes of being able to elicit more meaningful responses.\\
