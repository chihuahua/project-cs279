\section{Experiment}

% This section is the meat of the paper
% This section should carefully describe the experiment and our analysis (design of the experiment)

“how good is your entrepreneurial gut?” gamification as incentive

survey on app habits first prior to actual study:
how often do you use a smartphone?
how often do you download apps?
how often do you use apps?
how old are you?
what is your gender?
where are you from?

questionnaire that asks subjects to rate apps based on the different qualities on a Likert scale:
whether the pages feel fun?
how clear does the page describe the app’s purposes and functionalities?
how useful do you think the application will be based on its icon?

make sure participants are not biased due to having seen the app before → have you seen this app before? (if so, discard their response)
experiment design: description and 4 apps → which app do you think is the most successful one?
results given in groups of 5, then “do you want to try again?” → next batch of 5
