\section{Experiment}

% This section is the meat of the paper
% This section should carefully describe the experiment and our analysis (design of the experiment)
Our experiment will consist of an online study to be completed by volunteers through social media and potentially paid workers through Mechanical Turk. We decided to gamify our study in order to better incentivize, particularly volunteer, participants to complete the experiment. With the promise to tell users “How good is your entrepreneurial gut?,” we convince users to begin taking our experiment.

Prior to the actual study, we conduct a brief survey on the participants' online habits in order to gather relevant data to assess whether these habits have any correlation with our findings. The few questions asked include how often participants use a smartphone, or download or use apps. Then, participants complete a brief demographic survey. Once again, only a few questions are asked, mainly, how old the participant is, their gender, and country of origin.

For the actual study, participants view two applications........NEED TO DESCRIBE

Participants who indicate having seen one of the applications in the past receive a brand new set of applications to be compared.

NEED TO SPEAK ABOUT...results given in groups of 5, then “do you want to try again?” → next batch of 5
