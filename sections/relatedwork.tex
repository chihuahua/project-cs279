Prior research has examined, to a certain extent, first impressions as it relates to the visual appeal of web pages. For instance, different cultures perceive the visual appeal of web pages in different ways\cite{Reinecke:2013:PUF:2470654.2481281}. Further, people from different groups see web pages' complexity and color saturations very differently even during the very first impression of such sites\cite{Reinecke:2013:PUF:2470654.2481281}. Our research aims to delve deeper into first impressions and how it relates to people perceiving the apparent future success of a mobile application.

Developers already have insights as to the importance of gauging success of their application and how first impressions might be important\cite{wooldridge2010the}. For example, application developers consider aspects such as the layout of their icons or how to deliver a consistent messages to users when developing an application. However, such insights have not been further developed. In addition, mobile application success has been discussed in marketing research in relation to the importance of icons, titles, descriptions, screen shots, keywords, and categories\cite{mureta12:app}.

Similarly, web designers know that first impressions matter and users make such assessments within a very short amount of time\cite{needsource-attentionwebdesigners}. Lindgaard\cite{needsource-attentionwebdesigners} further mentions how aesthetics are often neglected in current studies on emotion and design even though emotional responses can be triggered much more quickly than rational ones. Our study will capitalize on this insight as we will examine how first impressions  significantly impact people's emotional response to an application as underlying reasons for their belief that the application will be a success or not.
