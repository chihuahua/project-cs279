%what problem will your work address? why is it important?
It has long been the goal of many to be able to know ahead of deployment whether a given product will be successful or not. Forecasting the success of a product ahead of deployment could save designers billions of dollars \cite{tohidi06:getting}. But the question still remains: How does one predict the success of an application?

Existing approaches involves deploying applications and potentially failing. To avoid the time-consuming and expensive process of deploying an application that might fail, mobile application developers, for example, take many measures to gauge the success of their applications prior to release.  The first may be the release of a beta version of their application to a restricted community before the release of that app to the public.  This allows them to estimate future interest. However, conducting a meaningful beta test requires a reliable and closed community of trustworthy individuals. Although many large firms have such resources, independent mobile application developers have to deploy their applications and modify them later \cite{website06:mobile}.  They learn through trial-and-error how to make their application more appealing.  Our approach has the potential to improve the aforementioned design process by helping designers get the right design prior to deployment \cite{tohidi06:getting}.

It has been well-established that first impressions matter. From interviews to website aesthetics, users form an opinion within the first few seconds of viewing a given stimuli. Thus far, first impressions have been used in the context of websites.  Since designers know that first impressions matter, independent mobile application developers have tried to obtain feedback on specific features of their application through advertisements and crowdsourcing services. Nevertheless, such services can be costly and the process, being unformalized, does not offer the developer a holistic view of the potential success of their application.  It simply offers them an idea of user opinion's regarding a feature in isolation.

The existing approach involves deploying an application and potentially failing. To avoid the time-consuming and expensive process of deploying an application that might fail, mobile application developers, for example, take many measures to gauge the success of their applications prior to release, one of which is releasing a beta version of their application to a restricted community before releasing the app to the public in order to estimate future interest\cite{betatest}. However, conducting a meaningful beta test requires a reliable and closed community of users. Although many large firms have such resources, independent mobile application developers have to just deploy their application and modify it, if possible, so that through trial-and-error the application might become more successful\cite{betatest}.

%what's your insight? how are you going to go after the problem?
For our approach, we will use Android mobile games to test during our experiment. We choose to use mobile games for our experiment as the data was widely available. As users' first impressions of mobile applications are most often made through the application store, our study will simulate the features found on such pages. We seek to establish this link by conducting a series of online studies. Success will be measured by an app's popularity, represented by the number downloads it obtains. Potential measurements to predict success used will be its icon, slogan, the aesthetic appeal of its screenshots, and description. Our studies will also include a demographics survey in order to better assess the mechanisms underlying the connection. For instance, people may think a given application will be successful because they perceive it as more trustworthy or fun.

We make the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
\item We establish a link between the way users feel about a given application measurement and the application's actual success.
\item We deliver a novel approach to predicting the success of mobile applications.
