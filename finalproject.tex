\begin{abstract}

The first impression that a game app makes plays an important role in its success, perhaps even more so than practical utility. Hence, the page of an app could determine much of the success of an app. Our project seeks to determine what specific factors about the app page matter in giving users a quality impressionÂ of a game app. We focus on Android games, but our results can be generalized to other platforms. \\

In fact, if users can predict the success of game apps based on features of app' pages such as names, icons, and screenshots, then developers can use the crowd to gauge the success of an app even before its release. We will see if users can effectively predict the success of apps based on just names and icons alone. We afterwards add in screenshots to see if they improve the accuracy of users' predictions. We seek to find if users' impressions of these specific features correlate with how often apps are downloaded. First impressions, we argue, really do matter.
