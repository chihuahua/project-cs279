\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
The factors that govern the success of a mobile application undergo a highly meritocratic and democratized process.  The public volitionally invests in applications with superior designs and better utility factors regardless of the amount of money a company had invested in its design.  Or do they? If well-implemented application succeed and poorly-designed applications fail, how do a handful of mindless diversions obtain mass favor over seemingly better crafted useful applications?   The road to success is risky and slightly unpredictable.  For that reason, we initiated this project in an attempt to gain clarity on a wide-scale macroeconomic event that occurs everyday: downloading a mobile application.  By examining descriptors on the application page we can determine if a correlation exists between quintessential words, icons, and phrases and the future success of that application.  This has the potential to save application designers copious amounts of money in market research geared towards understanding what incentivizes users to connect to applications. First impressions, we argue, really do matter.
