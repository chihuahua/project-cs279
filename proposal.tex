\section{Motivation}

\subsection{What problem will your work address?}

We are attempting to learn how much first impressions might impact the actual adoption of an Android game or productivity application. Mainly, we will examine what factors relevant to first impressions may contribute to the success of such apps. We plan to measure success through popularity (i.e. downloads, ratings). We hope to determine a good model for predicting application successes by examining observable measures for success of mobile applications on the Android Store.

\subsection{Why is it important?}

Currently, app developers take substantial measures to gauge the success of their apps prior to release. Many release a beta version of their app to a restricted community before releasing the app to the public. This beta test allows the developers to not only debug the app, but also obtain an estimate of how much interest their apps will garner. Conducting a meaningful beta test requires a reliable and closed community of trustworthy individuals. Many large firms have this community on hand. For instance, before Google released its iOS application for its Maps service, it first released it to its thousands of employees. Google then got feedback from these employees as well as statistics such as how long individuals stayed on the app and how often they returned. However, small developers do not have such a substantial community of individuals at their disposal for beta testing. Often, these developers just publish their app and monitor metrics over time, adjusting along the way. Our tool would help these developers by offering valuable predictors of app success. \\

Additionally, developers often test specific facets of their app on their own through ads and crowdsourcing services. To test how well an icon performs relative to viable alternatives, app developers sometimes release several different ads on social media sites such as Facebook. Each of these ads would showcase a different candidate icon for an app. A common measure for how well an icon performs in these cases is click-through rate. Similar ideas are often applied to tag lines and descriptions of apps. Additionally, services such as Ikonica offer developers the opportunity to send potential icons to a crowd of online individuals and collect their feedback. Our tool would not only formalize such processes that test different facets of an app in a single tool, but also offer a cheaper method for gauging app success through utilizing the common sense of Turkers or potentially other crowds.

\section{Approach}

\subsection{What’s your insight?}

We posit that we can create a way of predicting the success of a game or productivity application without having the developer release an app and monitor metrics in the wild for a duration. We base our tool on the premise that certain factors such as how fun the page of an app appears and how much a viewers trust that page or the app’s icon play a pivotal role in determining the game’s success. \\

Granted, many factors go into the success of game and productivity apps. Games, for instance, must be easily graspable at first, for instance. They must also become harder at a reasonable pace to keep the user engaged. Productivity apps must effectively meet concrete needs. We will be focusing on qualities pertaining to the page of an app, which matters in making strong first impressions.

\subsection{How are you going to go after the problem?}

We plan to leverage the common sense of crowds to gauge these facets and use this data to offer developers an estimate of the success of an app. We plan to develop a statistical model, perhaps based on regression from data gained from the crowd. To obtain data, we plan to scrape the names, icons, and descriptions of free game and productivity apps, so price does not bias one game over another. \\

Afterwards, we plan to develop a questionnaire that asks subjects to rate apps based on the different qualities on a Likert scale. These qualities could include how much subjects trust app pages, whether the pages feel fun, or how clear does the page describe the app’s purposes and functionalities. We plan to gamify this process by challenging subjects to test their entrepreneurial gut. We also plan to have Turkers be subjects. \\

After obtaining this data, we plan to perform a regression to determine how much each quality matters in determining the success of game apps. We then plan to use this regression result as a tool to predict the success of other apps. We also plan to talk to Katharina Reinecke about how else we can interpret our results.

\section{Contribution}

Our goal is to establish the link between the way people feel about given, observable measurements and the application's actual success, thus delivering a novel approach to predicting the success of mobile applications. We also plan to use this intuition to create a tool that allows users to cheaply predict the success of an application. Beyond software, we hope to determine what factors of the page of a game and productivity application that truly matter in determining the success of the app. This lasting piece of knowledge should benefit developers of games and productivity apps. \\
 
In other words, we intend to uncover the discrete, concrete elements that create subtle psychological influences in users and that propel users to download and use certain  application versus others.  Marketing is a very powerful tool; therefore, through uncovering the words, images, perceptions, and feelings that marketers have historically conveyed through their advertisements in the App Store and dissecting resulting users’ reactions to these subtleties, we can determine the elements that separate a mediocre from a successful marketing campaign. 

\section{Plan}

\subsection{Tuesday, Oct 29: Milestone 1:}

You are required to have a solid draft of a related work section. A good related work section is not just a list of other research --- it should be a thoughtful synthesis that highlights both the strengths and shortcomings of prior work and that contrasts prior work with what you hope to accomplish. \\

\subsubsection{Read recommended papers}
\begin{itemize}
\item “Dive into the literature a little bit to figure out why first impressions matter”
\item B. J. Fogg at Stanford might have done some relevant research
\item Katharina's recent paper is also a good example of how one builds on existing theory to design meaningful empirical investigation (http://iis.seas.harvard.edu/papers/2013/reinecke13aesthetics.pdf)
\item Research how to obtain necessary data
\item Find and read papers related to product first impressions / market research
\item Synthesize related work section from multiple sources
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tuesday, November 5: Milestone 2:}

You are encouraged to plan your project such that most of the building is done by this date. You should extend your paper by adding an appropriate
technology-related section.\\

During this phase we plan on designing,  implementing a study, and procuring the data. We will obtain participants from Lab in the Wild. The following highlights the aspects that we will accomplish by this date:

\begin{itemize}
\item Write a script to scrape information on 500 recent Android apps.
\item Design experiment
\item Develop hypotheses
\item Build experiment (potentially on Lab in the Wild)
\item Add dummy data
\item Run small sample study
\item Add pertinent data
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tuesday, November 12: Milestone 3:}

You should aim to have the meat of the paper written by this date (and have the corresponding work accomplished). The “meat” might, for example, be the section that carefully describes your experiment and your analysis. \\

	By this date we will have a substantial portion of the paper written to include conclusive metrics for mobile apps and a write up regarding how we chose those metrics.  At this time, we will also write up our experimental design, the factors that led us to choose those designs, assumptions we had about our participants, and how that affected the design and implementation of the research. In addition, any necessities to change the design of our study will be appropriately discussed. \\

\subsection{Tuesday, November 19: Milestone 4:}

You'd better had some data by now. The data should be rich enough so that you can reflect on which aspects of your project are working and which aren't. Submit a brief summary of the results and what they mean for your continuing progress. This write up probably won't make it into the final paper. \\

	We will continue to document trends and observations in our write-up and use that to refine what we really need and how we can best use these metrics to develop a conclusion that addresses whether our hypotheses proved to be right or wrong. \\

\begin{itemize}
\item Plan for data analysis 
\item Conduct data analysis
\item Accept or reject hypotheses
\item Writeup of data analysis and incorporation of results into paper 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tuesday, November 26: Milestone 5:}

Your technology should be finalized by now (based on the results from the previous milestone). Revise all sections (intro, related work, description of technology/approach, design of experiment) to reflect the current state of your project. \\

\begin{itemize}
\item Perform a complete review of the paper inspecting for syntax and diction, all the while ensuring that our formulas and tables are accurate and relevant.
\item Complete writeup of data analysis.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Marketing Research}

\subsection{The Business of iPhone App Development: Making and Marketing Apps that Succeed}

By Dave Woolridge and Michael Schneider (2010) \\

This book offered us some keen insights on how app developers currently gauge the success of their apps both after and before release. For instance, many services out there such as Mobclix provide rankings of apps based on download figures. App developers also read over the reviews of competitors to determine how well their services will be received. \\

App developers also emphasize first impression a lot according to this book. For instance, they value the layout of their icons. Developers should also value communicating a consistent message to the user. From this book, we determined several factors that could heavily influence first impressions of app pages. I wished that the book discussed how crowd sourcing could help app developers gauge app success though. This book was written in 2010, and gaining knowledge from crowds was not as substantial of a concept back then.

\subsection{Predicting Users's First Impressions of Website Aesthetics With a Quantiﬁcation of Perceived Visual Complexity and Colorfulness}

This paper examined how different groups of people perceived web pages of varying complexity and color saturations. The experimenters asked 548 participants to rate 450 different websites on a number of metrics. What intrigued me most about this paper was how it used quantitative measures to ascertain such soft qualities as page complexity and colorfulness. Perceived colorfulness even depended on the context of the colors. The experimenters nicely used the sum of the average and the standard deviation of the saturations to measure perceived colorfulness. \\

In our study, we will have to take similar measures. We are also trying to quantitatively gauge the effects of such soft qualities as trustworthiness and fun-ness of an app's page.

\subsection{Attention web designers: You have 50 milliseconds to make a good
first impression}

This paper examined how viewers of web pages really make their first impressions about a website within a very short amount of time. The paper emphasizes how aesthetics is often neglected in current studies on emotion and design. Apparently, emotional responses can be triggered much more quickly than rational ones. Humans are quick to assign words such as clean, symmetric, and dark to images. This article hence directly relates to our current studies since it discusses how first impressions can significantly impact people's emotional response to an app. Hence, we should ask users to rate their emotional responses to various apps and/or their icons. However, I feel that this paper also somewhat understates the importance of functionality. I wish it could further examine how important this emotional response is.

\subsection{App Empire: Make Money, Have a Life, and Let Technology Work for You}

By Chad Mureta (2012) \\

Since marketing plays such an essential role in the research we intend to pursue, we thought it best to examine literature related to mobile applications marketing research. In this book, Mureta highlights key insights regarding mobile application design and marketing which separate successful apps from non-successful ones.  Using raw, forthright diction, Mureta acts as sort of a personal mentor to the reader, using words that convey a sort of familial bond that is greatly disarming, psychologically enticing, but more importantly packed with valuable tips for fellow application entrepreneurs.  It is this direct, candid advice that we seek to capture.  Furthermore, with his pointed market overviews that focus on mobile application usage and financial statistics and his instructional section on "Sex App-eal" in which he maintains a discourse on the importance of icons, titles, descriptions, screen shots, keywords,and categories, Mureta's work will endow us with the knowledge and references we need to augment our understanding of mobile application design and develop better, more informed hypotheses regarding what makes a mobile application successful. Finally, the reliability of Mureta's claims are backed by his own success in the mobile application industry.\cite {mureta} \\

\subsection{Mobile Marketing Research Priorities: Roadmap to Engaging the 'Connected Customer}

(2006) \\

This article provides us with a better depth of understanding behind the theory of market research in the mobile application market. It hits upon several key concepts that will be important to incorporate and distinguish in our research.  This work also discusses the current trends and the future of mobile application marketing examining such topics as response fulfillment, research and data collection, store traffic generation, advertising, and branding, which will provide clues towards uncovering the psychological impulses that cause users to select one application over the other. It is a reliable first-hand resource from an organization that specializes in understanding what people want.\\
